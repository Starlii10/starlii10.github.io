I reserve the right to deny specific permissions to assets for specific people.
You CANNOT MAKE NSFW out of my characters/assets. I don't feel confortable.
You MAY NOT repost any of my content (without credit).
You CANNOT use my intellectual property for commercial use (making money DIRECTLY off it), regardless of credit.
I reserve the right to take down projects with my assets at any time and where I see fit, that includes DMCA takedown notices when I see fit.
If you are trying to post a modified/forked version of any of my property, PLEASE LET ME KNOW so I can at least greenlight it
Do not claim any of my works as your own.
You can take inspiration from my content, just give credit for the idea! (not needed but appreciated!)
Contact me if you see my assets used suspiciously!
i hate you content farms
