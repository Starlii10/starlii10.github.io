    That page doesn't exist! As such, I am forced to tell you about the first thing that comes to my mind. (Also I need to fill the page because the image to the side is too big)<br>
    <br>
    <strong>Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers</strong>, shortened to Ring Racers, is a kart racing Sonic fangame made by <a href="https://www.kartkrew.org/">Kart Krew Dev.</a> It's a sequel to SRB2Kart, which is based on the very popular Sonic Robo Blast 2, a Sonic fangame built upon the DOOM engine.<br>
    <br>
    I've been addicted to the game since I first played it, and I believe it is actually better than Mario Kart. Not even kidding. Go play it - it's free (and OPEN SOURCE!!!)<br>

    (The art you're seeing is from @moonchild6279 on Discord. Go check them out! They make great art.)<br>
