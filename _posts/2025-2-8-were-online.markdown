Took long enough.

Welcome to my new website! I've had this idea for a long while, but never had the motivation to actually finish it. It's just a simple website with a blog, project list, and about me! That's all you really need.

# The Inspiration

It began as part of my web development class last year. We ended up learning HTML and CSS, with a little bit of JavaScript. I made a very simple personal website with nothing but pure HTML5 and CSS3 (with JavaScript not used because... well, everyone hates JavaScript, let's face it). It got the job done, but I really wanted a blog of sorts.

I eventually learned about Jekyll and found a template online. I started customizing it... and never finished. I just didn't have the motivation to do it. So I just forgot about it...

# n_bonnie2

February 2, 2025. I was scrolling through Discord and noticed a user named "n_bonnie2" in a server I was in. Their status was a link to a GitHub Pages website: their personal website. And it, like, actually looked amazing?

And so I forked the repo, made some changes, and... yeah, now we're here. My own personal website.

# What's on here?

It's pretty barebones. Just a home page with a link to most of my socials, a blog, a projects page, and a mystery "More" page that I might do later. At least it's better than my old website. That thing looked like a toddler learned how to design in CSS.

# Does this mean...?

Probably. I might start putting character lore on here. I just have to... y'know, get the motivation to both write lore and make this website.

Anyways, that's pretty much it. Here, want a gift? Here's a little Meloetta on a plushie tag, created by my good friend [PixLuma](https://bsky.app/profile/pixluma.bsky.social).
