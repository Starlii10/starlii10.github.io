# What does this CHANGE?

EVERYTHING! yes, **EVERYTHING** like ***EVERYTHING*** i can do much more with a site i can control (the only limit is how much GitHub is willing to cooperate)

it's simply that i wanted to. It was supposed to be done *months* ago (the website idea was taken from former boncord admin TheDurbie) but after weeks and weeks of designing, I have done it, BonSite 3.0 has emerged...

That's all folks!
