Your favorite local starbot has been doing some fun things lately! Let's take a peek at some of the things that have happened.

## Winter Break

Yep! From Friday 2/14 to Tuesday 2/18, I don't have any school! I can just chill out. It's the main reason I've done so much lately.

## Modding my Switch

I recently ordered an RCM jig from Amazon that should allow me to mod my Switch! Finally, I don't have to be limited to Basic Black and Basic White themes! (And I guess I can also mod Splatoon and Smash Ultimate, but I prefer customization.)

And if I get banned... well, the Switch 2 is coming out soon, so, y'know...

## Live and Learn (Starlii Mix)

Guess who's doing another remix? Gotta take advantage of my somewhat decent FL Studio knowledge... even though I don't have the greatest collection of VSTs. But hey, you can't beg or borrow, or you'll never find your way!

## Sonic Robo Blast 2 Streams

I did another SRB2 stream with [BOIgaming33](https://boigaming33.carrd.co/) and [SentientToaster](https://sentienttoaster.carrd.co/)! We played the Pizza Time mod with a randomizer on, and that was absolute cinema. I really want to stream more...

## Site Update

n_bonnie2, otherwise known as underscoreBon, updated his site recently! Since Starlii's Website is based on it, I went and updated everything here based on the changes he made. (That was painful because you can't just pull request it. I had to do it myself in VS Code, which makes me dread the day he drops BonSite v4-)
