Wait... You finally did it. You made a website for reals.

Yeah... I decided to abandon my carrd site and migrated HERE!

# What does this CHANGE?

EVERYTHING! yes, **EVERYTHING** like ***EVERYTHING*** i can do much more with a site i can control (the only limit is how much GitHub is willing to cooperate)

## why?

it's simply that i wanted to. It was supposed to be done *months* ago (the website idea was taken from former boncord admin TheDurbie)
